# Rules and Scoring

This page explains the rules and scoring for the finals.

Basically, the rules are the same as [the rules for the preliminary round](../rule/index.html), but since the actual golf carts will be used, some of the rules and scoring methods have been changed.

## Challenges for the Finals

- The contestants will be required to complete the following tasks.
  - Task 1: Stop before a small obstacle (cardboard box) and re-start after removing the obstacle.
  - Challenge 2: Driving through smoke
  - Task 3-1: Driving through S-curves (slalom)
  - Task 3-2: Driving through L-curves (crank)
- The contestants are required to start the automatic driving from the start point and aim to reach the goal point.

## Scoring Method

- Ranking is determined by distance points.
  - `Distance points: min(Distance traveled in Task 3-1 (m) + Distance traveled in Task 3-2, distance of the entire Task 3 courses) * (1.0 - assignment 1 penalty - assignment 2 penalty - assignment 3 penalty)`
- If the distance points are the same, the Competitor with the shortest running time in the Task 3 area will be placed higher (if he/she runs to the end of the task).

## Competition Rules

The rules governing the entire competition are as follows

- Driving speed is 0~5km/h
- If the speed exceeds the speed limit by more than 2km/h, disqualification = 0 points
- Time limit is 5 minutes (to accommodate the case where the vehicle stops in the middle of the route)
- Time is measured from the time the vehicle starts.
- Please do not use an algorithm that sets the route in advance and drives in a deterministic manner.
- The content of the submitted code may be checked during the judging.
- If any intentional irregularities are discovered, such as codes that affect the scoring process, the contestant will be disqualified.

### Conditions for Completion of Run

If any of the following conditions are met, the automatic driving will end immediately and the distance points at that point will be recorded.

At this time, the vehicle’s automatic driving mode is automatically deactivated and the vehicle also stops immediately.

- Exceeds the speed limit of 7 km/h
- Exceeds the time limit of 5 minutes
- Any part of the vehicle body deviates from the travel lane

### Override Conditions

When any of the following conditions are met, the safety driver in the driver’s seat of the vehicle intervenes in the driving operation and switches to manual operation (implementation of override).

At this time, the distance point immediately before the override time is recorded. The safety driver manually drives the vehicle to a safe point and stops it. The participants can try to drive automatically from this point again.

- If the vehicle is too close to an obstacle and the safety driver determines that it is dangerous
