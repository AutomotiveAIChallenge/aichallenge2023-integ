## How to ask questions  
&emsp;Please send questions about &emsp;competitions, repository contents, etc. via an issue on github. You can ask questions in either English or Japanese.   
&emsp;When your question is resolved, please close the issue.    

â€»We will generally respond to questions on each issue within two business days.  
However, we may take more than 2 business days for questions that require time for consideration or when there are a large number of questions. Please understand.
