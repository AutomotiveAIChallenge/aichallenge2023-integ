## Automated AI Challenge 2023 Integration Competition
![AIchallenge2023](../images/top/aichallenge2023.png)  
&emsp; This page is for the Automated Driving AI Challenge 2023 Integration Competition, which will be held from July to October 2023.  
  
&emsp; Participants will develop self-driving software based on Autoware.Universe.  The goal is to complete three themed challenges in a self-driving car integrated with the developed software and complete the course in a short period of time.  
&emsp; The competition is divided into a qualifying round and a main round. In the qualifying round, contestants will drive their self-driving cars on AWSIM, a digital twin self-driving simulator. In the main competition, contestants will tune and develop their cars based on data obtained from their actual cars, and then take on a course similar to the qualifying round, prepared in a realistic environment.

## Competition Concept
&emsp;While a new technological area called CASE is at the center of competition in the automotive industry, there is a shortage of AI and IT engineers, and the need for them is rapidly increasing throughout the automotive industry.
As a new initiative to discover and nurture engineers who will lead the automotive industry in the future, we will hold an international competition for AI technology in automated driving.
The aim is to build a framework that will contribute to the further development of the automotive industry, starting with this competition, in which industry, government, and academia will cooperate.

## Challenge Themes
 The automated driving systems used in automated factory conveyance are required to have both low vehicle cost and high task processing capability. Therefore, the challenge is to achieve a good balance between safety, availability, and drivability under the constraints of limited computing resources and simple sensor configurations.

### Safety
 &emsp; In an environment where humans and robots work together, it is necessary to prevent accidents during encounters with workers emerging from the shadows of equipment, and to detect and reliably and safely stop leftover objects placed randomly on the walkway.

### Availability
 &emsp;In petrochemical plants, for example, vapors released from pipes installed close to the ground can block the view of sensors. Driving in diverse environments requires a cognitive system that can drive in environments where steam and smoke are present.

### Drivability.
  & emsp; In the interior spaces of factories and warehouses, there are narrow paths that a forklift can barely pass through, as well as aisles that run between equipment and shelves. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a function that can smoothly travel along complicated narrow paths.
